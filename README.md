The goal of rSPARQLanything is to provide an interface to SPARQL
Anything, a system for Semantic Web re-engineering that allows users to
query anything with SPARQL. It uses a single generic abstraction for all
data source formats called Facade-X. This meta-model used by SPARQL
Anything transformers to generate RDF data (a widely used data
representation model that forms the cornerstone of the Semantic Web)
from diverse data sources. Intuitively, Facade-X uses a subset of RDF as
a general approach to represent the source content as-it-is but in RDF.
The package interface takes inspiration from the Python
‘pysparql-anything’ library.
