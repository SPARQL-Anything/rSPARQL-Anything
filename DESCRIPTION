Description: rSPARQLanything provides an interface to SPARQL Anything, a system for 
    Semantic Web re-engineering that allows users to query anything with SPARQL. 
    It uses a single generic abstraction for all data source formats called 
    Facade-X. This meta-model used by SPARQL Anything transformers to generate 
    RDF data (a widely used data representation model that forms the cornerstone 
    of the Semantic Web) from diverse data sources. Intuitively, 
    Facade-X uses a subset of RDF as a general approach to represent the source 
    content as-it-is but in RDF. The package interface takes inspiration from the 
    Python 'pysparql-anything' library.
